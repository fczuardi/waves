# Global Game Jam 2017

## Research of javascript game-related libraries

The idea is to collect and learn how to use some physics and sprites rendering
libs necessary for a 2D boat-golf game.

## Building the developer environment

```
yarn install
yarn build:libs
yarn start:demos
```

## Game bundle

`
yarn bundle:app
`
