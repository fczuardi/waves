# Global Game Jam 2017

## Research of javascript game-related libraries

The idea is to collect and learn how to use some physics and sprites rendering
libs necessary for a 2D boat-golf game.

## Building the developer environment

```
yarn install
yarn build:libs
yarn start
```

## Building the Game bundle

`
yarn bundle:app
`

## Formatting a javascript file (uses prettier)

`
yarn format -- path/to/filename
`
